# spot-livestream-pi

Research was focused on planning and implementing "on the fly" Spot livestreaming capabilities to Twitch servers. This means, rather than having a dedicated laptop/workstation have to follow around Spot, a small device could be mounted to Spot and triggered for immediate livestreaming to www.twitch.tv servers.

Twitch is by far the most popular livestreaming service on the web, and a successful on the fly implementation of Spot's cam to this service would be great for highlighting Mizzou's work with Spot. If successfully implemented, the project could be taken further by running a chat bot system on the mounted device that could elevate and give certain twitch chat users privileges to control spot functionalities such as movement or camera options offered in the development kit. Integration for these things should be easy into to students' work such as Stephen Bowen.

Hardware: 
Raspberry Pi 4B:
A group of students has already successfully mounted a pi to spot and successfully powered it through one of spot's interfaces. It can be used as a networked "brain" for spot. Read more about this here: https://github.com/MURobotics/Spot-Pi
